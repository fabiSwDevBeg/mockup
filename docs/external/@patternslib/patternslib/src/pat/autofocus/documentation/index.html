<h2>Description</h2>
<p>With the Autofocus pattern you may choose which input field gets the focus when a page load, or after it was injected.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Patterns augments the standard HTML5 autofocus behaviour, and implements it for browsers that do not support it natively.</p>
<p>On initial page load or when new content is injected it is scanned for input elements with an <code>autofocus</code> attribute or <code>pat-autofocus</code> class.</p>
<p>The first such element that has no current value will be given the focus.</p>
<p></p><form>
<label>Title <input type="text" autofocus="autofocus" name="title" value="My document"></label>
<label>Keywords <input type="text" autofocus="autofocus" name="keywords"></label>
</form><p></p>
<p>In this example the keywords input field would be given the focus since the title field already has a value.</p>
